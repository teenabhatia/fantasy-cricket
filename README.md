# fantasy-cricket
A Flask website that allows you to manage your fantasy cricket team for any cricket tournament/matches using web scraping (from Cricbuzz.com). 

To start with a clean slate (no saved data), simply delete the following files after cloning the repository: 'friend_assignments.json', 'processed_urls.json', 'player_stats.xlsx'. 
To run the website locally, clone the repository and run it in the terminal using the command "python app.py" or equivalent.
